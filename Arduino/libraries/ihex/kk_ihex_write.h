/*
 * kk_ihex_write.h: A simple library for writing Intel HEX data. 
 * See the accompanying kk_ihex_read.h for read support, and the
 * main header kk_ihex.h for the shared parts.
 *
 *
 *      WRITING BINARY DATA AS INTEL HEX
 *      --------------------------------
 *
 * In order to write out data, the `ihex_write_at_address` or
 * `ihex_write_at_segment` functions are used to set the data location,
 * and then the binary bytes are written with `ihex_write_byte` and/or
 * `ihex_write_bytes`. The writing functions will then call the function
 * `ihex_flush_buffer` whenever the internal write buffer needs to be
 * cleared - it is up to the caller to provide an implementation of
 * `ihex_flush_buffer` to do the actual writing. See below for details
 * and an example implementation.
 *
 * See the declaration further down for an example implementation.
 *
 * The sequence to write data in IHEX format is:
 *      struct ihex_state ihex;
 *      ihex_init(&ihex);
 *      ihex_write_at_address(&ihex, 0);
 *      ihex_write_bytes(&ihex, my_data, length_of_my_data);
 *      ihex_end_write(&ihex);
 *
 * For outputs larger than 64KiB, 32-bit linear addresses are output. Normally
 * the initial linear extended address record of zero is NOT written - it can
 * be forced by setting `ihex->flags |= IHEX_FLAG_ADDRESS_OVERFLOW` before
 * writing the first byte.
 *
 * Gaps in the data may be created by calling `ihex_write_at_address` with the
 * new starting address without calling `ihex_end_write` in between.
 *
 *
 * The same `struct ihex_state` may be used either for reading or writing,
 * but NOT both at the same time. Furthermore, a global output buffer is
 * used for writing, i.e., multiple threads must not write simultaneously
 * (but multiple writes may be interleaved).
 *
 *
 *      CONSERVING MEMORY
 *      -----------------
 *
 * If you are using only the write support, you should define
 * `IHEX_LINE_MAX_LENGTH` as the length of your output line. This makes
 * both the `struct ihex_state' and the internal write buffer smaller.
 * For example, 32 or even 16 can be used instead of the default 255.
 *
 * If the write functionality is not used all the time and can thus
 * share its write buffer memory with something else that is inactive
 * during writing IHEX, you can define `IHEX_EXTERNAL_WRITE_BUFFER` and
 * provide the buffer as `char *ihex_write_buffer`. The size of the
 * buffer must be at least `IHEX_WRITE_BUFFER_LENGTH` bytes and it must
 * be valid for the entire duration from the first call to a write function
 * until after the last call to `ihex_end_write`. Note that there is
 * no advantage to this unless something else, mutually exclusive with
 * IHEX writing, can share the memory.
 *
 * If you are reading IHEX as well, then you'll end up limiting the
 * maximum length of line that can be read. In that case you may wish to
 * define `IHEX_MAX_OUTPUT_LINE_LENGTH` as smaller to decrease the
 * write buffer size, but keep `IHEX_LINE_MAX_LENGTH` at 255 to support
 * reading any IHEX file.
